= Supported Databases

ExClaim is built for two different database backends:

* The https://www.h2database.com/[_H2_] database backend can use an embedded database server running in the same JVM as the application.
  The database is written to a single file.
  There are no external dependencies and no need to configure anything.
+
NOTE: This is the recommended choice for small setups and during development.
+
* The https://www.postgresql.org/[_PostgreSQL_] database backend requires an external PostgreSQL database server and some xref:administrator-documentation:configuration:database.adoc#postgresql[configuration].
  This database variant is recommended for large installations.

IMPORTANT: There is a different `.jar` file for each database variant.
  They are _not_ compatible with each other.

IMPORTANT: There is currently no method to migrate from one database variant to another.
