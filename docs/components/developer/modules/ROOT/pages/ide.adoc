= IDE Recommendation

We recommend to use https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] for backend development.
The product is available in two editions:

* Community Edition (open source, Apache-2.0 license, https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community[GitHub])
* Ultimate Edition (commercial license).
  Students and faculty staff members can https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/cpp-leaflet/students/[get a free license].

The Ultimate Edition has several features regarding the Spring Framework that are not available in the Community Edition.
We therefore recommend Ultimate Edition if you can get a free license.

NOTE: Open the whole project in IntelliJ IDEA, i.e. the repository directory containing the files `gradle.properties` and `settings.gradle.kts`.

For frontend development, please see xref:frontend:ide.adoc[this separate page].
