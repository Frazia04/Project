= Project Setup

You need to install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js].
Use the same major version as the `nodejs_version` configured in `gradle.properties` (in the repository root directory).


== Install and Update Dependencies

Before starting and every time `package.json` has been changed, you need to run:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
----

To update dependencies within the ranges defined in `package.json`, run:

[source,bash]
----
npm update
----

To update the ranges defined in `package.json`, you can use a tool like https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates[`npm-check-updates`].
