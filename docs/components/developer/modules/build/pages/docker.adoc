= Docker

Some tasks require external services:

* Building the PostgreSQL variant of ExClaim requires access to a PostgreSQL database server.
  The task xref:tasks/generate-jooq.adoc[`generateJooqPostgreSql`], which is a dependency of `bootJarPostgreSql` and `bootRunPostgreSql`, runs our database migrations on an empty database and then lets the jOOQ code generator generate Java source code representing our database schema.
* Running end-to-end tests requires access to a Selenium Grid.
  This affects all `:app:endToEndTest\{Database\}\{Browser\}` tasks.
  Additionally, the `:app:endToEndTestPostgreSql\{Browser\}` tasks require access to a PostgreSQL database server for the application under test.


[#testcontainers]
== Testcontainers

Our Gradle build uses https://www.testcontainers.org/[_Testcontainers_] to automatically spin up temporary Docker containers with the required services.
This requires Docker available on your machine and appropriate permissions for the user executing the Gradle build to use Docker.


=== Ryuk

Testcontainers starts an additional container called _Ryuk_.
Its purpose is to remove containers created by Testcontainers that for some reason have not been cleaned up.
Our build is configured to stop and remove created containers after the task has finished (no matter if successful or failed).
But when manually aborting the build process, containers might remain.

Ryuk stays active as long as the https://docs.gradle.org/8.7/userguide/gradle_daemon.html[_Gradle Daemon_] is running.
The Ryuk container, together with other containers that were not stopped, should disappear a few seconds after the Gradle Daemon has stopped.
To stop the Gradle Daemon, execute:

.Stop the Gradle Daemon on Windows
[source,bash]
----
gradlew.bat --stop
----

.Stop the Gradle Daemon on Linux/macOS
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew --stop
----

When using IntelliJ IDEA, the Gradle Daemon automatically stops when closing the IDE.

NOTE: When changing code in `buildSrc`, then Gradle uses a fresh class loader for the next build, resulting in a new Testcontainers https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/blob/1.19.7/core/src/main/java/org/testcontainers/DockerClientFactory.java#L63[_session id_] with a separate Ryuk container.
  When the Gradle Daemon stops, all these Ryuk containers will stop.


== Building without Docker

If you do not have Docker then you can

* either stick to the tasks not requiring external services (i.e. build the H2 database variant only and do not run end-to-end tests)
* or start the required services yourself and tell our build where to find them using <<environment-variables,environment variables>>.


[#environment-variables]
=== Environment Variables

NOTE: It is not recommended to manage the services yourself, use <<testcontainers>> if possible.
  The only reason for having this option is to avoid Docker in Docker in GitLab CI builds.

.PostgreSQL Server
* `POSTGRES_URL`: JDBC URL to the database.
  The format is `jdbc:postgresql://host/database`.
  See the https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/use/#connecting-to-the-database[PostgreSQL JDBC driver documentation] for details.
+
CAUTION: All data in this database will be deleted!
  Do _not_ let this environment variable point to a production database!

* `POSTGRES_USER`: The username to connect to the database.
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password to connect to the database.

.Selenium (end-to-end tests)
* `SELENIUM_CHROME_URL`: URL for the Selenium `RemoteWebDriver` providing Chrome.
* `SELENIUM_FIREFOX_URL`: URL for the Selenium `RemoteWebDriver` providing Firefox.
* `SELENIUM_HOST_ADDRESS`: Hostname or ip address where the Selenium browser can reach the host running the Gradle build.
