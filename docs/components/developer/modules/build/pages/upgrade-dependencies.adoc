= Upgrade Dependencies

== Gradle Wrapper

If you want to upgrade the wrapper to a new version of Gradle, execute the following command *twice*:

----
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version latest
----

The first execution changes files in `gradle/wrapper/`.
The second one might update `gradlew(.bat)` (if the new Gradle version comes with updated versions of these scripts).
Additionally, the upgrade also changes the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file as configured in the root `build.gradle.kts` file (the `image` setting for the `build` job must match the Gradle wrapper version).
Make sure to commit all these changes together.

Please be kind to other developers and update this `README.md` file such that all references to the Gradle documentation point to the new version.
For major version updates, please also check that the links are still resolvable.


== Other Dependencies

The project dependencies are configured in the `build.gradle.kts` files inside the subproject directories (see the `dependencies` blocks).
You can look up the latest available version on https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Central].
To understand the different configurations (`implementation`, `runtimeOnly`, etc.) refer to the https://docs.gradle.org/8.7/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management[dependency management section] in the Java Gradle plugin documentation.

Some specific version numbers (like the Spring Boot version) would normally appear in multiple places.
To keep the version consistent, we define them as constants in the `gradle.properties` file, e.g. `spring_boot_version` for the version of Spring Boot.

Spring Boot https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.2.x/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#managing-dependencies-gradle-bom-support[manages dependency versions] for many Spring components and third-party libraries.
Therefore, most dependencies do not need a version number and will update together with Spring Boot.
However, we still explicitly specify the version if the dependency is required in other places (outside of the Spring Boot application) as well, e.g. for Flyway and jOOQ.
There we need to ensure that the selected version is compatible with Spring Boot.
See the comment in the `gradle.properties` file when updating those versions.
