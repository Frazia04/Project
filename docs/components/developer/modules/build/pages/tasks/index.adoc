= Gradle Tasks

== Execute Gradle Tasks

When you have opened the project in IntelliJ IDEA, then it is recommended to use its user interface to execute tasks.
See https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-gradle-tasks.html#gradle_tasks[their documentation] for details.

To execute a Gradle Task from command line, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Then execute `gradlew.bat` on Windows or `./gradlew` on Linux/macOS, followed by the name of the task you want to execute.

.Execute task `bootJarH2` on Windows
[source,bash]
----
gradlew.bat bootJarH2
----

.Execute task `bootJarH2` on Linux/macOS
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootJarH2
----

== Task Paths (Subprojects)

We use several xref:project-structure:index.adoc[_subprojects_] to structure our Gradle build.
When you execute for example the task `check`, then Gradle will execute the `check` task in all subprojects having such a task.

To execute a task in a single subproject only, you must specify the task's full path.
For the task `check` in subproject `app` this would be `:app:check`.
