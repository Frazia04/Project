= Executing ExClaim (`bootRun`)
:navtitle: Executing (`bootRun`)

IMPORTANT: There is a separate Gradle Task for each xref:administrator-documentation:ROOT:database-variants.adoc[supported database variant].

During development, you can execute ExClaim using the ``bootRun``footnote:[The "`boot`" part of the name was chosen by the _Spring Boot_ Framework] task corresponding to the desired database variant.
This is much faster than first building a `.jar` file and then executing it.
When opening the project in IntelliJ IDEA, it should automatically create a run configuration for each of the tasks.

|bootRun (PostgreSQL)

See the administrator documentation for xref:administrator-documentation:execute:index.adoc#access[how to access the application].


== Command Line Arguments

If you would like to pass command line arguments to ExClaim, for example to xref:administrator-documentation:execute:create-admin-account.adoc[create an admin account], then execute the task as follows:

.Create an admin account on Windows, using the H2 database variant
[source,bash]
----
gradlew.bat bootRunH2 --args='admin -u my_username -p my_secret_password'
----

.Create an admin account on Linux/macOS, using the H2 database variant
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRunH2 --args='admin -u my_username -p my_secret_password'
----


== Working Directory

When executing ExClaim via `bootRun`, then the current working directory is the `app/` directory.
This is where ExClaim will store the H2 database file.
If you need some custom xref:administrator-documentation:configuration:index.adoc[configuration], then create an `application.properties` file in `app/`.
All these files are listed in `.gitignore` such that they are not added to the repository.

IMPORTANT: Do not confuse `app/application.properties` with `app/src/main/resources/application.properties`.
  The former contains your custom configuration when executing ExClaim via `bootRun` (ignored by git, i.e. not part of the repository).
  The latter is our default configuration that we ship with ExClaim (part of the repository).
