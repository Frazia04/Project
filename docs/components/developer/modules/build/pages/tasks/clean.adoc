= Cleanup (`clean`)

The `clean` task deletes all files that have been generated during previous builds.
You can use it to get rid of caches and then build from scratch if something is broken.
When opening the project in IntelliJ IDEA, it should automatically create a run configuration named "`clean`" for this task.
