= Testing ExClaim (`check`)
:navtitle: Testing (`check`)

The `check` task is a standard Gradle task that depends on all tests.
When opening the project in IntelliJ IDEA, it should automatically create a run configuration named "`check`" for this task.


== Select Tests to Execute

When used without xref:./index.adoc#paths[subproject path], then the `check` task will execute all available tests in all subprojects.
Alternatively, you can execute an individual test task.
You can explore available test tasks in the IntelliJ IDEA user interface or by executing:

.List all test tasks in the `app` subproject on Windows
[source,bash]
----
gradlew.bat :app:tasks --group=verification
----

.List all test tasks in the `app` subproject on Linux/macOS
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew :app:tasks --group=verification
----
